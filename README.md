# About-Me----Resume
I am a post-grad student at The University of Texas at San Antonio(UTSA). 
<br /> I come from Nepal. A mountaneous country where less than 40% of people have college education. With hopes, dreams and bit more determination I am fortunate to have higher education in the US.  
<br />
My goal in life is to learn and share the knowledge to make this world a better place. I believe everyone should get the privilege of education. I also believe that science and technology should not be an option for it will make us understand everything, living or dead, around us.  
<br />
My professional goal is to be an expert in Cyber Security and Computing Technologies. I have been researching in computer network and security since 3 years. Within those years I have investigated Medical Devices Security, Mobile Device Security and  IoT. I am currently studying security aspects in Cloud Computing.
