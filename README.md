# About-Me----Resume
I am a post-grad student at The University of Texas at San Antonio(UTSA). 
My goal in life is to learn and share the knowledge to make this world a better place. I believe everyone should get the privilege of education. I also believe that science and technology should not be an option for it will make us understand everything, living or dead, around us.
